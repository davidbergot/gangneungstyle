preview: Week-end in Gangneung, walking in the city and along the beach
---

This weekend was [Chuseok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuseok "Chuseok on Wikipedia") in South Korea. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were bank holidays, which gave us some time to visit.

On the weekend, we walked in the city of Gangneung and to the beach. Gangneung is on the coast and has several beaches that are very nice. On top of that, the weather was great (sunny and 27 degrees), so I went for a swim in the warm water.

The path along the beach is covered by pine trees, a symbol of Gangneung. Sometimes, we can see a bunker, reminding us that South Korea and North Korea are (technically) still at war, but they don't seem to be used a lot.

We can already see signs that Gangneung will host part of the 2018 Winter Olympics, as several Olympic rings are displayed around the city.

One last word about coffee: it is very popular here, and can be drunk cold. In every supermarket or convenience stores, small bottles or cans of coffee are  displayed in fridges alongside fruit juices. It is actually better than I expected.
