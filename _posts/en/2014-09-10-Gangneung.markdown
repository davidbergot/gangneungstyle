preview: First impression of Korea, PyeongChang and Gangneung
---

Here we go, we have moved to Korea.

It has already been a week, and even if we haven't had much time to explore, we had the time to enjoy a good range of different Korean food, and visit the city a bit. 

We spent the first week in Alpensia, in PyongChang. This is a ski resort that looks very similar to the ones I kow in France, except for the Korean characters on the sign posts. There are not a lot of summer activities, but the mountains are very green. Next week, we are moving to [Gangneung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangneung "Gangneung on Wikipedia"), a coastal city.


Below is a selection of pictures illustrating different aspect of our discoveries so far.
