preview: Two days of the Chuseok long weekend exploring the capital, Seoul
---

On Monday and Tuesday of the long weekend we took a quick trip to Seoul to see some traditional Korean sites and find out what the capital had to offer. Not everything was open because many people had returned to their home towns to celebrate with their families, but it gave us a chance to explore without the regular chaos of the city.

First we visited one of the ancient palaces and gardens, making a huge natural park in the city centre. The buildings were impressive and it was a great place to really feel like we were in Asia, although David was melting in the summer heat!

We visited the local market where we had some food (it tasted nice but probably wasn't the smartest idea ever!) - we were surprised at how un-touristic it was .. not a postcard in sight. Then we discovered Myeong Dong, the shopping / eating / going out district which felt more like Europe than Asia - save for the dried fish and fried octopus tentacles for sale at regular intervals along the market.

We finished off a busy day with a trip up the cable car to the N Seoul Tower - and after a long wait to get to the top, we discovered that the tower was already closed. We still had a decent view from the bottom, and hopefully we can return on a clearer day to be able to see further.

Our second day was spent through a return to the market, visiting a fancy department store to see which western products we would be able to acquire on subsequent trips to Seoul, then wandering through the Gangnam area, trying to understand the Gangnam Style a little better.

Overall we were very impressed with the ease of use of the subway and the easy trip from Gangneung. Hopefully we will be able to return at regular intervals to explore further.
